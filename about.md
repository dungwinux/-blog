Hi! My name Dung Nguyen. It is your choice to either sit back and read or skim through paragraphs.

I hold Master of Science and Bachelor of Computer Science at UMass Amherst. My interest are Low-level programming, Computer systems, and Cybersecurity.
It is my goal to reach the deepest core of code execution, to break down every layers of concept and abstraction on the way, and to realize dream's program with elegance.

In 2016, seeing and learning Free Pascal secondary school, my first instinct was to build an interpreter.
Transforming knowledge from _Understanding and Writing Compilers_ by Richard Bornat, I wrote [vmath](https://github.com/winux8yt3/vmath/) - a math program that calculates, solves equations, and plots polynomials. It also embodies my early conceptualization of building and maintaining a large scale project.

Thoughout my high school, I studied data structure and competitive programming in C++. Like many others, the transition beyond my first language is difficult, but overcoming it reveals to me a common view of all C-family language. This laid the way for me to learn many other languages: JavaScript, Haskell, C#, Rust, etc. 

At UMass Amherst, I heaviliy study System and Security.
My favorite classes are [CompSci 335-535-635 series (Computer Architecture)](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~weems/homepage/courses/index.html) by Professor Charles Weems, and [CompSci 390R (Reverse Engineering)](https://pwn.umasscybersec.org/) by Steven Rossi and Gilbert Hoermann. Those set ablaze my love for studying low-level and Instruction Set Architectures. I also joined UMass Cybersec Club at the time and was trained on Pentesting and Vulerability Analysis.

From 2020-2024, I played CTF for team SavedByTheShell, mainly in reversing, pwn, and forensics categories.
I also wrote challenges for UMassCTF from 2022-2025; their details can be found in my blog.

From the header, you might recognize this as the domain of my personal blog, where you can find links to various contents relating to CTF, (human & programming) languages, and anything I found worth documenting for the sake of history.

Bonus: To pronounce my first name, it is similar to _Jung_ as in [_Carl Jung_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung). If you are a linguist, here is an accurate version in IPA: [zʊwŋ͡m˦ˀ˥]
