Hi! My name Dung Nguyen. Welcome to my page.
If you are here to learn more about me, you're at the exact place.

At this moment, I'm an undergraduate junior at UMass Amherst, pursuing degree in
Computer Science. I study Compiler and Software Development.

During secondary school, I worked on my first compiler/interpreter:
[vmath](https://winux8yt3.github.io/vmath/).
Written in Pascal, it can parse simple arithmetics and several math functions.
Albeit the language has limitations, it has graphing capabilities as well as i18n support.
My interest in Compiler started ever since.

In my free time, I play CTF for team SavedByTheShell in forensics and reversing
categories.
I was part of the team organizing UMassCTF 2022, creating 2 forensic challenges:
tino and mere. Both building instruction and solutions are available on my GitHub.
[Post-mortem of UMassCTF 2022](/-blog/{% post_url 2022-04-05-umassctf22-postmortem %})
is available on the blog.

You are currently in the domain of my personal blog. You may find contents
related to coding, languages, and some of my side interests.
If you have any questions, email me,
I would be more than welcome to answer your curiosity.
