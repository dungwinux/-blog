Hi! My name Dung Nguyen. Welcome to my page.

At the moment, I am a graduate at UMass Amherst, pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science. I study Computer Systems, Security, and Compiler.

During secondary school, I worked on my very first compiler/interpreter:
[vmath](https://winux8yt3.github.io/vmath/).
Written in Free Pascal, it can read commands, parse expression, and compute floating-point arithmetics. it also has graphing capabilities as well as i18n support.
My interests in Computer Systems and Compiler started ever since.

At UMass Amherst, I heaviliy study Computer System and Security.
My favorite classes are [CompSci 335-535-635 series (Computer Architecture)](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~weems/homepage/courses/index.html) by Professor Charles Weems, and [CompSci 390R (Reverse Engineering)](https://pwn.umasscybersec.org/) by Steven Rossi and Gilbert Hoermann. Those have made my desire to reverse and study various Instruction Set Architectures strong.

In my free time, I play CTF for team SavedByTheShell in the reversing, pwn, and forensics categories.
I was also part of the team organizing UMassCTF 2022, 2023, and 2024.

Here in the domain of my personal blog, you may find contents
related to CTF, human & programming languages, and some of my side interests.
If you have any questions, email me, and I would be more than happy to answer.

In case you wonder how to pronounce my first name, you can try _Jung_ as in [_Carl Jung_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung). If you are a linguist, here is the IPA: [zʊwŋ͡m˦ˀ˥]

`c3`
