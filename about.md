Hi! My name Dung Nguyen. Welcome to my page.

At this moment, I'm a graduate at UMass Amherst, pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science. I study Computer Systems, Security, Compiler, and Software Development.

During secondary school, I worked on my very first compiler:
[vmath](https://winux8yt3.github.io/vmath/).
Written in Pascal, it can compute floating-point arithmetics and several math functions.
Albeit the language has limited extensions, it has graphing capabilities as well as i18n support.
My interests in Computer Systems and Compiler started ever since.

At UMass Amherst, I heaviliy study Computer System and Security.
My favorite classes are [CompSci 335-535-635 series (Computer Architecture)](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~weems/homepage/courses/index.html) by Charles Weems, and [CompSci 390R (Reverse Engineering)](https://pwn.umasscybersec.org/) by Steven Rossi and Gilbert Hoermann.

In my free time, I play CTF for team SavedByTheShell in the reversing, pwn, and forensics categories.
I was also part of the team organizing UMassCTF 2022, 2023, and 2024.

You are currently in the domain of my personal blog, where you may find contents
related to CTF, (human & computer) languages, and some of my side interests.
If you have any questions, email me, and I would be more than happy to answer.
